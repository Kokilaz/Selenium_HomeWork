<p>This class focuses on communication skills supporting patient decision making. We’ll explore how the real-life, stressful setting with insufficient information that often characterizes palliative care situations may hinder our patients’ decision-making. We will also consider how culture may influence patients’ participation in healthcare decisions. Taking these influences into account will improve our navigation of goals of care conversations and family meetings. Knowledgeable application of communication skills may also help patients and physicians avoid conflict and misunderstandings.</p>
