<section class="tab-panel" id="Overview">
<p>The challenges for social workers who attend to persons who are dying and to those around them can be thought of, at the most basic level, as knowing what you are facing; understanding your reactions; and knowing how to help. The social worker’s role as an advocate for the patient and the family is strengthened by the depth of our knowledge and our comfort and confidence in speaking with the health care team.</p>

<p>This class will review the symptoms of pre-active and active dying and how to help the family at the bedside manage these. We’ll consider what people who are dying want and fear, and how these concerns may change over the course of their dying. We’ll explore how decision making and communication affect the patient’s dying experience, including considering how hope and a poor prognosis interact. Participants will be invited to share their personal and professional introductions to death. We will also consider our strengths and weaknesses as advocates. Finally, we will practice some easy exercises to help ourselves remain grounded despite the whirlwind of emotions around us.</p>
